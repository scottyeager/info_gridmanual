# How to Deploy Digibyte Node on eVDC

Through our partnership with the DigiByte Foundation, we empower the DGB community with a decentralized cloud infrastructure to deploy DigiByte nodes and help secure and expand the DGB network across the geographical edges.

- Anyone can contribute and build upon the DigiByte Blockchain using the ThreeFold P2P cloud and its developer tools that provide significant advantages over centralized cloud providers.
- Thousands of people are running DigiByte software all across the planet.
- Any server, computer, tablet or mobile phone connected to the DigiByte network becomes a node that helps relay transactions.

# Get Started

You can now deploy your own DigiByte full Node via the ThreeFold Now Marketplace's dashboard on your eVDC admin panel in a few clicks.
