#Blockchain Solutions on eVDC

This is a collection of tools for specific blockchains which allow their node operators and community members to deploy their respective nodes on a true peer-to-peer cloud infrastructure â€“ and in just a few clicks. Some of the benefits for blockchain communities include:

- True IT decentralization (both storage and compute). Nodes on the ThreeFold Grid are fully-decentralized rather than hosted on commercial services, meaning more control and autonomy for both you and the blockchain.

- More cost-effective than centralized cloud providers. Workloads on the ThreeFold Grid are more efficient and require less energy to operate, meaning lower costs & environmental impact.

- More privacy and security. Protect your digital identity with the enhanced privacy provided by the 3Bot infrastructure. Ensure the integrity of the blockchain with the built-in security features of the ThreeFold Grid.
Easier to use and quicker to deploy. Our solutions aim to add ease and efficiencies for blockchain community members including one-click deployment.
