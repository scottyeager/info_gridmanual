# Set up a network for your solution

Set up a network for interconnecting the different Kubernetes pods and volumes comes out of the box with Kubernetes. 

Please check in the Kubernetes Network Policies on how to establish a network, interconnecting pods and expose it to the outside world using ingress (version 2.3 of traefik available in our configuration, with tcp forwarding) and egress.
