# Transfer TFT from eVDC Wallet

When you have successfully funded your eVDC Wallet with additional TFT, you could also transfer this balance to another eVDC Wallet, or any other stellar wallet. In order to transfer TFT from your eVDC to a stellar wallet, there are a few different wallet options you can transfer your TFT to. Read more about supported wallets information on [How get and store TFT tutorial](https://manual2.threefold.io/#/mainnet_gettft).

On testnet, a TFT transfer is recommended periodically. Since testnet is used for testing purposes, there will be times when a testnet reset is necessary to be done, thus resulting in evdc wallet, workloads, solutions and evdc accounts become deleted. Therefore, we always remind users to transfer their TFT Balance out of their active eVDC wallet before the reset takes place. 

__Please keep in mind that we would not be able to refund any TFT after each testnet reset is done, if you fail to transfer the TFT out of your eVDC beforehand.__

- You can transfer your TFT from eVDC mainnet or testnet onto a third party Stellar wallet (mainnet), like Sollar Wallet or Interstellar Wallet. 
-  You should only transfer your TFT to __a mainnet stellar wallet__, regardless if it is currently on eVDC wallet testnet. Since we are only using mainnet TFT for testing purposes.
