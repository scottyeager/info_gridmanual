## Get ThreeFold Connect App and 3Bot ID

As the first step, you need to get yourself a **ThreeFold Connect** and **3Bot ID**. This could be done by downloading the app on your smartphone and create your own 3Bot Identity. 

Please be aware that this ID is going to be used as your main digital identity on the ThreeFold Grid, and holds the keys to access every services on the grid. Therefore, it's very important to remember the login data and the seed phrase of your ID. The ThreeFold Connect App will also provide you with an access to your 3Bot Wallet where you could store your ThreeFold Tokens.

## Get and Store TFT to Reserve for Your IT Capacity

To reserve IT Capacity and pay for your workload on top of the TF Grid, you would need to purchase some TFT and store it on one of your wallets. To store your TFT, you could use the __3Bot Wallet__ on your ThreeFold Connect App, a __third-party stellar wallet__, or the __pre-configured 3Bot wallet__ on your hosted 3Bot. To get more TFT, you could __buy or trade other tokens__ into TFT from one of the supporting exchangers, or purchase TFT directly from the farms.
