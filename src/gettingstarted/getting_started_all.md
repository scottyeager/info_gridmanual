# Getting Started

To get started and deploy a solution on top of the TF Grid, you would need to first figure out of whether you would like to build on top of the __TF Grid Testnet__ or __TF Grid Mainnet__. 

- Go to [__Start on Mainnet__](mainnet_getting_started.md) : the production net (grid 2.3)

> Please keep in mind that the two networks are completely separated, and thus every activity done on testnet cannot be applied to the mainnet, and vice versa.
